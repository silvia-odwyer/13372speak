# LeetSpeakTranslator
A Kotlin Android app that converts strings to 1337speak. 

## Screenshots
Screenshots can explain more than any amount of words :)
This is the Translator activity, featuring quite a basic dark-themed UI, but this will be edited hugely in the coming weeks.

Here's the Home activity, which will be displayed upon app launch:

## Current State
As of 03-02-18, this app translates strings to 1337speak, and also includes special support
for reserved words such as "hacker" and "you" where they have their own 1337speak variants
rather than the defacto standard. 

Users can copy the 1337 messages to their clipboard, so that they can send them to their friends
quickly and easily.

Also, users can translate any language to basic 1337 or advanced 1337, depending on which translate
button they press.
The UI currently implements a dark-theme UI, but I will be altering this hugely in the coming weeks
so that it includes slightly glowing text and more SVGs.

## Future Development Plans
- Create a Home Screen, which leads the user to the translator itself
- Modify the buttons so that they change colour when pressed
- Incorporate a more fluid and "glowy" dark-theme UI
- Convert the current buttons to SVGs which can be resized according to the device size.

## Current Bugs That Need To Be Fixed
- Apostrophes don't appear to be supported yet.
- The editText for the 1337message doesn't allow for copying and pasting yet.

I hope to complete this app by mid-March 2018, and it may even be sold for free on the Google Play Store.
