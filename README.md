# LeetSpeakTranslator
A Kotlin Android app that converts any language to 1337speak. 

## Current State
As of 17-02-18, this app can translate strings to 1337speak, and also include special support
for reserved words such as "hacker" and "you" where they have their own 1337speak variants
rather than the defacto standard. 
It allows the user to either translate to basic 1337 or more advanced 1337, with each type
having symbols with increasing difficulty to read/decode.
The UI currently implements a dark-theme UI, but I will be altering this hugely in the coming weeks
so that it includes slightly glowing text and more SVGs.

## Future Development Plans
- Create a Home Screen, which leads the user to the translator itself.
- Allow the user to copy the text from the actual output (an obvious feature, but I'm getting to it!)
- Incorporate a more fluid and "glowy" dark-theme UI
- Convert the current buttons to SVGs which can be resized according to the device size.

I hope to complete this app by mid-March 2018, and it may even be sold for free on the Google Play Store.
If you'd like to beta test or provide any comments, just let me know :)
